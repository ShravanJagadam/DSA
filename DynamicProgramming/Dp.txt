Medium : 
1.Jump game array, check if we can reach the last index or not 
2.Jobs and Machine
3.Painting Houses
4.Maximum Non-Adjacent subsequence sum.
5.ComputeNCR
6.LIS (N^2 Solution and N Soltuion)
7.Bitnoic Sequence.
7.Knapsack (Integer Knapsack) -->  0-1 Knapsack
8.Subset Sum->check if there is subset with given sum
9.Count Subset Sums Equals K ->Count the no of ways of selecting a subset such that the sum is K
10.Forbidden Skipping.  Find the max sum of a subsequence on a condition such that if you skip ith element, you cannot skip "i-1"th and "i+1"th element.
