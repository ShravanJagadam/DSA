basic 
1.Full Binary Tree (check if the BT is a FBT or not ) FBT : 0 or 2 child nodes for each node 
2.Check if the given BST is a complete Binary tree : CBT : every level is filled completely expect the last level, which would be filled from left to right.
3.check BST (check if the given binary tree is a BST or not)
4.Left view of the Binary tree.
5.Right view of the binary tree.
6.Count of Nodes at distance K from the source node.




Medium
1.Preorder Inorder to Postorder    :     Print the postOrder from the preOrder and InOrder traversals of the binary tree(2 Approaches : construct a binary tree and then print postOrder, Approach 2 : directly print the postOrder without constructing the binary tree)
2.Sum of Numbers from Root to Leaf Paths
3.vertical Order Traversal.
4.Diagonal Order Traversal;
5.Top view of the tree ( 2 Approaches )
6.Least(Lowest) common Ancestor (LCA) of Binary Search Tree.
7.Diameter of the tree
8.Width of the tree.
