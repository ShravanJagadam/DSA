/*Nodes at Distance K 
Given an array of unique elements, construct a Binary Search Tree and find the number of nodes at a distance K from the given source node S. Distance is defined as the number of edges between 2 nodes.



Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by 2T lines. The first line of each test case contains N, S, K - the number of nodes in the BST, the source node, and the distance K. The next line contains N unique integers - the value of the nodes.



Output Format

For each test case, print the number of nodes in the Binary Search Tree which are K distance away from S, separated by newline.



Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= N <= 1000

0 <= ar[i] <= 10000
